# Iris-Flower-Classification

i have participate in an internship conducted by codsoft. My Challenge is to build a model that classify the iris flower Variety.The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their measurements.My objective is to train a machine learning model that can learn from these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into their respective species.

Use the Iris dataset to develop a model that can classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements.
